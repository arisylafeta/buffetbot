This way , no matter what natural ability you start\\nwith, you will substantially increase your hitting average. One common\\nproblem for investors is that they tend to swing too often. This is true for\\nboth individuals and for professional investors operating under institutional\\nimperatives, one version of which drove me out of the conventional\\nlong/short hedge fund operation.

Consider investing in a total stock-market index fund and contribute regularly, regardless of market conditions.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Comparisons**: Do not measure your financial success against others. Your performance is independent of what others are doing in the market.\\n\\n4. **Continuous Learning**: Read extensively to enhance your knowledge and understanding of investing principles.\\n\\n5. **Patience and Discipline**: Invest consistently and resist the urge to react impulsively to market trends.

Buffett and his partner, Charles Munger, have\\\\ncombined Graham’s “margin of safety” and detachment from\\\\nthe market with their own innovative emphasis on future growth.Here is an all-too-brief summary of Buffett’s approach:\\\\nHe looks for what he calls “franchise” companies with strong\\\\nconsumer brands, easily understandable businesses, robustfinancial health, and near-monopolies in their markets, like H & R\\\\nBlock, Gillette, and the Washington Post Co. Buffett likes to\\\\nsnap up a stock when a scandal, big loss, or other bad newspasses over it like a storm cloud—as when he bought Coca-Cola\\\\nsoon after its disastrous rollout of “New Coke” and the market\\\\ncrash of 1987 . He also wants to see managers who set andmeet realistic goals; build their businesses from within rather\\\\nthan through acquisition; allocate capital wisely; and do not pay\\\\nthemselves hundred-million-dollar jackpots of stock options.Buffett insists on steady and sustainable growth in earnings, sothe company will be worth more in the future than it is today.\\\\nIn his annual reports, archived at www.berkshirehathaway.\\\\ncom, Buffett has set out his thinking like an open book. Probably\\\\nno other investor, Graham included, has publicly revealed more\\\\nabout his approach or written such compellingly readableessays. (One classic Buffett proverb: “When a management\\\\nwith a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputa-\\\\ntion for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business thatremains intact. ”) Every intelligent investor can—and should—learn\\\\nby reading this master’s own words.\\'), 0.03225806451612903)\\n\\n(Document(metadata={\\'source\\': \\'warren_buffet_portfolio.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 14}, page_content=\\'Page 6\\\\nA New Choice\\\\nWhat does Warren Buffett say about this ongoing debate regarding index versus active strategy? \\\\nGiven these two particular choices, he would unhesitatingly pick indexing. Especially if he were thinking of investors with a very low tolerance for risk, and people who know very little about the economics of a business but still want to participate in the long-term benefits of investing in common stocks. \"By periodically investing in an index fund,\" Buffett says in his inimitable style, \"the know-\\\\nnothing investor can actually outperform most investment professionals.\" \\\\n2\\\\nBuffett, however, would be quick to point out that there is a third alternative, a very different kind of \\\\nactive portfolio strategy that significantly increases the odds of beating the index. That alternative is focus investing.\\\\nFocus Investing: The Big Picture\\\\n\"Find Outstanding Companies\"\\\\nOver the years, Warren Buffett has developed a way of choosing the companies he considers worthy \\\\nplaces to put his money. His choice rests on a notion of great common sense: if the company itself is doing well and is managed by smart people, eventually its inherent value will be reflected in its stock price. Buffett thus devotes most of his attention not to tracking share price but to analyzing the economics of the underlying business and assessing its management.\\\\nThis is not to suggest that analyzing the company—uncovering all the information that tells us its \\\\neconomic value—is particularly easy. It does indeed take some work. But Buffett has often remarked that doing this \"homework\" requires no more energy\\\\n  \\'), 0.016666666666666666)\\n\\n(Document(metadata={\\'source\\': \\'warren_buffet_portfolio.pdf\\', \\'page\\': 24}, page_content=\\'Page 16\\\\nJohn Maynard Keynes. What Buffett did, with stunning success, was apply the rationale, even before \\\\nhe gave it its name. The question that fascinates me is why Wall Street, noted for its unabashed willingness to copy success, has so far disregarded focus investing as a legitimate approach.\\\\nIn 1995, we launched Legg Mason Focus Trust, only the second mutual fund to purposely own \\\\nfifteen (or fewer) stocks. (The first was Sequoia Fund; its story is told in Chapter 3.) Focus Trust has given me the invaluable experience of managing a focus portfolio. Over the past four years, I have had the opportunity to interact with shareholders, consultants, analysts, other portfolio managers, and the financial media, and what I have learned has led me to believe that focus investors operate in a world far different from the one that dominates the investment industry. The simple truth is, they \\\\nthink differently.\\\\nCharlie Munger helped me to understand this pattern of thinking by using the very powerful \\\\nmetaphor of a latticework of models. In 1995, Munger delivered a lecture entitled \"Investment Expertise as a Subdivision of Elementary, Worldly Wisdom\" to Professor Guilford Babcock\\\\\\'s class at the University of Southern California School of Business. The lecture, which was covered in OID, was particularly fun for Charlie because it centered around a topic that he considers especially important: how people achieve true understanding, or what he calls \"worldly wisdom.\"\\\\nA simple exercise of compiling and quoting facts and figures is not enough. Rather, Munger explains, \\\\nwisdom is very much about how facts align and combine. He believes that the only way to achieve \\\\nwisdom is to be able to hang life\\\\\\'s experience across a broad cross-section of mental models. \"You\\\\\\'ve \\\\ngot to have models in your head,\" he explained, \"and you\\\\\\'ve got to array your experience—both \\\\nvicarious and direct—on this latticework of models.\" (OID) \\\\n13\\\\n  \\'), 0.016666666666666666)\\n\\nQuestion: how do I invest like you?\\n',\n",
       " 'To invest like Warren Buffett, consider the following key principles based on his investment philosophy:\\n\\n1. **Focus on Quality Companies**: Look for \"franchise\" companies with strong consumer brands, understandable business models, robust financial health, and a competitive edge in their markets.\\n\\n2. **Evaluate Management**: Assess the management team\\'s ability to realize the company\\'s potential and allocate capital wisely. Look for managers who set realistic goals and prioritize shareholder interests over personal gain.\\n\\n3. **Long-Term Perspective**: Invest with a long-term horizon in mind. Buffett believes that if a company is fundamentally strong, its stock price will eventually reflect its true value.\\n\\n4. **Margin of Safety**: Always consider the margin of safety when investing. This means buying stocks at a price that is significantly below their intrinsic value to minimize risk.\\n\\n5. **Do Your Homework**: Conduct thorough research and analysis of the companies you are interested in. Understand their economic value and the factors that influence their performance.\\n\\n6. **Consider Indexing for Beginners**: If you\\'re new to investing or have a low tolerance for risk, Buffett suggests that investing in index funds can be a good strategy, as it allows you to participate in the long-term growth of the market.\\n\\n7. **Focus Investing**: Instead of diversifying broadly, consider a focus investing strategy where you concentrate on a smaller number of high-quality stocks. This approach requires a deep understanding of each company.\\n\\n8. **Stay Disciplined and Patient**: Avoid being swayed by market trends or short-term volatility.

Second, they think a great deal about what they do\\nand how to do it, but they pay very little attention to what the market isdoing.402 Commentary on Chapter 15\\n3There are also many newsletters dedicated to analyzing professional port-\\nfolios, but most of them are a waste of time and money for even the most\\nenterprising investor. A shining exception for people who can spare thecash is Outstanding Investor Digest (www.oid.com).\\n\\nIn the past we have made a basic distinction between two kinds\\nof investors to whom this book was addressed—the “defensive”\\nand the “enterprising.” The defensive (or passive) investor will\\nplace his chief emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes orlosses. His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, andthe need for making frequent decisions. The determining trait ofthe enterprising (or active, or aggressive) investor is his willingnessto devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both\\nsound and more attractive than the average. Over many decades\\nan enterprising investor of this sort could expect a worthwhilereward for his extra skill and effort, in the form of a better average\\nreturn than that realized by the passive investor. We have some\\ndoubt whether a really substantial extra recompense is promised tothe active investor under today’s conditions. But next year or theyears after may well be different. We shall accordingly continue todevote attention to the possibilities for enterprising investment, asthey existed in former periods and may return.\\nIt has long been the prevalent view that the art of success-\\nful investment lies first in the choice of those industries that \\nare most likely to grow in the future and then in identifying the\\nmost promising companies in these industries. For example, smart\\ninvestors—or their smart advisers—would long ago have recog-\\nnized the great growth possibilities of the computer industry as a\\nwhole and of International Business Machines in particular. And\\nsimilarly for a number of other growth industries and growth com-panies. But this is not as easy as it always looks in retrospect. To\\nbring this point home at the outset let us add here a paragraph thatwe included first in the 1949 edition of this book.\\nSuch an investor may for example be a buyer of air-transport\\nstocks because he believes their future is even more brilliant than\\nthe trend the market already reflects. For this class of investor the\\nvalue of our book will lie more in its warnings against the pitfallslurking in this favorite investment approach than in any positive\\ntechnique that will help him along his path.*6 Introduction\\n* “Air-transport stocks, ” of course, generated as much excitement in the late\\n1940s and early 1950s as Internet stocks did a half century later.
