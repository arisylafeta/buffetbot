At long last the stock market has\\n“returned to normal,” in the sense that both speculators and stock\\ninvestors must again be prepared to experience significant and per-\\nhaps protracted falls as well as rises in the value of their holdings.\\nIn the area of many secondary and third-line common stocks,\\nespecially recently floated enterprises, the havoc wrought by thelast market break was catastrophic. This was nothing new initself—it had happened to a similar degree in 1961–62—but there\\nwas now a novel element in the fact that some of the investment\\nfunds had large commitments in highly speculative and obviouslyovervalued issues of this type. Evidently it is not only the tyro who\\nneeds to be warned that while enthusiasm may be necessary for\\ngreat accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invari-ably leads to disaster.\\nThe major question we shall have to deal with grows out of the\\nhuge rise in the rate of interest on first-quality bonds. Since late 1967the investor has been able to obtain more than twice as much\\nincome from such bonds as he could from dividends on representa-\\ntive common stocks. At the beginning of 1972 the return was 7.19%on highest-grade bonds versus only 2.76% on industrial stocks.\\n(This compares with 4.40% and 2.92% respectively at the end of\\n1964.) It is hard to realize that when we first wrote this book in 1949the figures were almost the exact opposite: the bonds returned only\\n2.66% and the stocks yielded 6.82%.\\n2In previous editions we have\\nconsistently urged that at least 25% of the conservative investor’s\\nportfolio be held in common stocks, and we have favored in generala 50–50 division between the two media. We must now considerwhether the current great advantage of bond yields over stock\\nyields would justify an all-bond policy until a more sensible rela-\\ntionship returns, as we expect it will. Naturally the question of con-tinued inflation will be of great importance in reaching our decision\\nhere. A chapter will be devoted to this discussion.*What This Book Expects to Accomplish 5\\n* See Chapter 2. As of the beginning of 2003, U.S. Treasury bonds matur-\\ning in 10 years yielded 3.8%, while stocks (as measured by the Dow JonesIndustrial Average) yielded 1.9%.

At one extreme we have had savings banks, life-insurancecompanies, and so-called legal trust funds. A generation ago theirinvestments were limited by law in many states to high-grade\\nbonds and, in some cases, high-grade preferred stocks. At the other\\nextreme we have the well-to-do and experienced businessman,who will include any kind of bond or stock in his security list pro-\\nvided he considers it an attractive purchase.\\nIt has been an old and sound principle that those who cannot\\nafford to take risks should be content with a relatively low returnon their invested funds. From this there has developed the general\\nnotion that the rate of return which the investor should aim for ismore or less proportionate to the degree of risk he is ready to run.\\nOur view is different. The rate of return sought should be depen-\\ndent, rather, on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is will-ing and able to bring to bear on his task. The minimum return goes\\nto our passive investor, who wants both safety and freedom fromconcern. The maximum return would be realized by the alert and\\nenterprising investor who exercises maximum intelligence and\\nskill. In 1965 we added: “In many cases there may be less real risk\\nassociated with buying a ‘bargain issue’ offering the chance of alarge profit than with a conventional bond purchase yielding about4\\n1⁄2%.” This statement had more truth in it than we ourselves sus-\\npected, since in subsequent years even the best long-term bondslost a substantial part of their market value because of the rise ininterest rates.\\n88'), 0.03200204813108039), (Document(metadata={'source': 'intelligent_investor.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='of the fact that the interest and principal payments on good bonds\\nare much better protected and therefore more certain than the divi-\\ndends and price appreciation on stocks.

If wecould be sure that this conclusion is right we would have to advisethe defensive investor to put allhis money in bonds and none in\\ncommon stocks until the current yield relationship changes signifi-\\ncantly in favor of stocks.\\nBut of course we cannot be certain that bonds will work out bet-\\nter than stocks from today’s levels. The reader will immediatelythink of the inflation factor as a potent reason on the other side. In\\nthe next chapter we shall argue that our considerable experiencewith inflation in the United States during this century would notsupport the choice of stocks against bonds at present differentialsin yield. But there is always the possibility—though we consider itremote—of an accelerating inflation, which in one way or another\\nwould have to make stock equities preferable to bonds payable in a\\nfixed amount of dollars.* There is the alternative possibility—which we also consider highly unlikely—that American business\\nwill become so profitable, without stepped-up inflation, as to jus-\\ntify a large increase in common-stock values in the next few years.Finally, there is the more familiar possibility that we shall witness\\nanother great speculative rise in the stock market without a real\\njustification in the underlying values. Any of these reasons, andperhaps others we haven’t thought of, might cause the investor to\\nregret a 100% concentration on bonds even at their more favorable\\nyield levels.\\nHence, after this foreshortened discussion of the major consider-\\nations, we once again enunciate the same basic compromise policy26 The Intelligent Investor\\n* Since 1997 , when Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or TIPS) were\\nintroduced, stocks have no longer been the automatically superior choice\\nfor investors who expect inflation to increase. TIPS, unlike other bonds, rise\\nin value if the Consumer Price Index goes up, effectively immunizing theinvestor against losing money after inflation.

The shrinkage in the purchasing\\npower of the dollar in the past, and particularly the fear (or hopeby speculators) of a serious further decline in the future, hasgreatly influenced the thinking of Wall Street. It is clear that those\\nwith a fixed dollar income will suffer when the cost of living\\nadvances, and the same applies to a fixed amount of dollar princi-pal. Holders of stocks, on the other hand, have the possibility that a\\nloss of the dollar’s purchasing power may be offset by advances in\\ntheir dividends and the prices of their shares.\\nOn the basis of these undeniable facts many financial authorities\\nhave concluded that (1) bonds are an inherently undesirable formof investment, and (2) consequently, common stocks are by theirvery nature more desirable investments than bonds.
