Bonds or bond funds? Since bonds are generally sold in $10,000
lots and you need a bare minimum of 10 bonds to diversify away therisk that any one of them might go bust, buying individual bonds
makes no sense unless you have at least $100,000 to invest. (Theonly exception is bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, since they’re pro-
tected against default by the full force of the American government.)
Bond funds offer cheap and easy diversification, along with the
convenience of monthly income, which you can reinvest right back into
the fund at current rates without paying a commission. For mostinvestors, bond funds beat individual bonds hands down (the mainexceptions are Treasury securities and some municipal bonds). Major

The choices for bond investors have proliferated like rabbits, so

CASH IS NOT TRASH
How can you wring more income out of your cash? The intelligent
investor should consider moving out of bank certificates of deposit or
money-market accounts—which have offered meager returns lately—into some of these cash alternatives:

of these .400 hitters. As Buffett once said, ""The key to life is to figure out who to be the batboy for."" 
4
Think of Stocks as Businesses
""In our view,"" says Buffett, ""investment students need only two well-taught courses—How to Value 
a Business, and How to Think About Market Prices.""5
The necessary first step for anyone who wants to emulate Warren Buffett's approach is to think about 
stocks first and foremost as businesses. ""Whenever Charlie and I buy common stocks for Berkshire, we approach the transaction as if we were buying into a private business. We look at the economic 
prospects of the business, the people in charge of running it, and the price we must pay.""
6 The 
specifics of what he looks for are presented in the Warren Buffett Way investment tenets, which you 
will find summarized in Chapter 1.
""Your goal as an investor should be simply to purchase, at a rational price, a part interest in an easily 
understandable business whose earnings are virtually certain to be materially higher, five, ten, and twenty years from now,"" explains Buffett. ""Over time, you will find only a few companies that meet 
these standards—so when you see one that qualifies, you should buy a meaningful amount of stock.""
7
Increase the Size of Your Investment
""I wouldn't want to buy anything where I wouldn't want to put 10 percent of my net worth into it,"" 
confesses Buffett. ""If I don't want to put that into it, then it just isn't much of an idea."" (OID)8
How many stocks should an investor own? Buffett would tell you it depends on your investment 
approach. If you have the
  

approach is up your alley. If you always feel rushed, crave simplicity,
and don’t relish thinking about money, then the passive approach is foryou. (Some people will feel most comfortable combining both meth-ods—creating a portfolio that is mainly active and partly passive, orvice versa.)
Both approaches are equally intelligent, and you can be successful
with either—but only if you know yourself well enough to pick the rightone, stick with it over the course of your investing lifetime, and keep
your costs and emotions under control. Graham’s distinction betweenactive and passive investors is another of his reminders that financial
risk lies not only where most of us look for it—in the economy or in ourinvestments—but also within ourselves.
CAN YOU BE BRAVE, OR WILL YOU CAVE?
How, then, should a defensive investor get started? The first and most
basic decision is how much to put in stocks and how much to put inbonds and cash. (Note that Graham deliberately places this discus-
sion after his chapter on inflation, forearming you with the knowledge
that inflation is one of your worst enemies.)
The most striking thing about Graham’s discussion of how to allo-
cate your assets between stocks and bonds is that he never mentionsthe word “age. ” That sets his advice firmly against the winds of con-
ventional wisdom—which holds that how much investing risk you oughtto take depends mainly on how old you are.
2A traditional rule of thumb
was to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of yourassets in stocks, with the rest in bonds or cash. (A 28-year-old wouldput 72% of her money in stocks; an 81-year-old would put only 19%
there.) Like everything else, these assumptions got overheated in the
late 1990s. By 1999, a popular book argued that if you were youngerthan 30 you should put 95% of your money in stocks—even if you had
only a “moderate” tolerance for risk!

two main points. The first was that they had offered a considerable
degree of protection against the erosion of the investor’s dollar
caused by inflation, whereas bonds offered no protection at all. The
second advantage of common stocks lay in their higher averagereturn to investors over the years. This was produced both by anaverage dividend income exceeding the yield on good bonds andby an underlying tendency for market value to increase over theyears in consequence of the reinvestment of undistributed profits.
While these two advantages have been of major importance—
and have given common stocks a far better record than bonds over the long-term past—we have consistently warned that these
benefits could be lost by the stock buyer if he pays too high a price
for his shares. This was clearly the case in 1929, and it took 25 yearsfor the market level to climb back to the ledge from which it had abysmally fallen in 1929–1932.* Since 1957 common stockshave once again, through their high prices, lost their traditionaladvantage in dividend yield over bond interest rates.† It remains toThe Defensive Investor and Common Stocks 113
* The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a then-record high of 381.17
on September 3, 1929. It did not close above that level until November 23,
1954—more than a quarter of a century later—when it hit 382.74. (When you
say you intend to own stocks “for the long run, ” do you realize just how longthe long run can be—or that many investors who bought in 1929 were no
longer even alive by 1954?) However, for patient investors who reinvested
their income, stock returns were positive over this otherwise dismal period,simply because dividend yields averaged more than 5.6% per year. Accord-
ing to professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton of London
Business School, if you had invested $1 in U.S. stocks in 1900 and spentall your dividends, your stock portfolio would have grown to $198 by 2000.But if you had reinvested all your dividends, your stock portfolio would have
been worth $16,797! Far from being an afterthought, dividends are the
greatest force in stock investing.† Why do the “high prices” of stocks affect their dividend yields? A stock’s
yield is the ratio of its cash dividend to the price of one share of common
stock. If a company pays a $2 annual dividend when its stock price is $100per share, its yield is 2%. But if the stock price doubles while the dividendstays constant, the dividend yield will drop to 1%. In 1959, when the trendGraham spotted in 1957 became noticeable to everyone, most Wall Street

have practiced using a ledger of hypothetical buys and sells on a 
legal pad; nowadays, you can use “portfolio trackers” at websites likewww.morningstar.com, http://finance.yahoo.com, http://money.cnn.com/services/portfolio/ or www.marketocracy.com (at the last site,ignore the “market-beating” hype on its funds and other services).
By test-driving your techniques before trying them with real money,
you can make mistakes without incurring any actual losses, developthe discipline to avoid frequent trading, compare your approach
against those of leading money managers, and learn what works foryou. Best of all, tracking the outcome of all your stock picks will pre-
vent you from forgetting that some of your hunches turn out to bestinkers. That will force you to learn from your winners andyour losers.
After a year, measure your results against how you would have done if
you had put all your money in an S & P 500 index fund. If you didn’tenjoy the experiment or your picks were poor, no harm done—selectingindividual stocks is not for you. Get yourself an index fund and stop
wasting your time on stock picking.
If you enjoyed the experiment and earned sufficiently good returns,
gradually assemble a basket of stocks—but limit it to a maximum of10% of your overall portfolio (keep the rest in an index fund). And
remember, you can always stop if it no longer interests you or yourreturns turn bad.
LOOKING UNDER THE RIGHT ROCKS
So how should you go about looking for a potentially rewarding
stock? You can use websites like http://finance.yahoo.com andwww.morningstar.com to screen stocks with the statistical filters sug-
gested in Chapter 14. Or you can take a more patient, craftsmanlike
approach. Unlike most people, many of the best professional investorsfirst get interested in a company when its share price goes down, not
up. Christopher Browne of Tweedy Browne Global Value Fund,
William Nygren of the Oakmark Fund, Robert Rodriguez of FPA Capi-tal Fund, and Robert Torray of the Torray Fund all suggest looking at
the daily list of new 52-week lows in the Wall Street Journal or the
similar table in the “Market Week” section of Barron’s. That will point
you toward stocks and industries that are unfashionable or unloved
and that thus offer the potential for high returns once perceptionschange.

Question: As a beginner, should I invest in stocks or bonds? Why?
","As a beginner, investing in bonds may be a more suitable choice than stocks for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity and Predictability**: Bonds, particularly intermediate-term bonds, provide a simpler investment option that does not require you to guess future interest rates. They tend to offer more predictable returns compared to stocks, which can be volatile and influenced by various market factors.

2. **Diversification**: If you are considering individual bonds, you typically need a significant amount of capital (at least $100,000) to diversify effectively. However, bond funds offer an easy way to achieve diversification with lower investment amounts, reducing the risk associated with any single bond defaulting.

3. **Income Generation**: Bond funds provide the convenience of monthly income, which can be reinvested without incurring commissions. This can be particularly appealing for beginners looking for steady cash flow.

4. **Lower Risk**: Bonds are generally considered less risky than stocks, especially U.S. Treasury bonds, which are backed by the government and protected against default. This makes them a safer option for those who may not be comfortable with the higher risks associated with stock investments.

5. **Understanding Your Comfort Level**: If you prefer a more passive investment approach and want to avoid the complexities of stock picking, bonds or bond funds may align better with your investment style.

In summary, for a beginner, bonds or bond funds can provide a more straightforward, lower-risk investment option that allows for income generation and diversification without the need for extensive market knowledge or active management.",2.180788040161133,"Human: Answer the following question based on this context:

of the fact that the interest and principal payments on good bonds
are much better protected and therefore more certain than the divi-
dends and price appreciation on stocks. Consequently we are
forced to the conclusion that now, toward the end of 1971, bondinvestment appears clearly preferable to stock investment. If wecould be sure that this conclusion is right we would have to advisethe defensive investor to put allhis money in bonds and none in
common stocks until the current yield relationship changes signifi-
cantly in favor of stocks.
But of course we cannot be certain that bonds will work out bet-
ter than stocks from today’s levels. The reader will immediatelythink of the inflation factor as a potent reason on the other side. In
the next chapter we shall argue that our considerable experiencewith inflation in the United States during this century would notsupport the choice of stocks against bonds at present differentialsin yield. But there is always the possibility—though we consider itremote—of an accelerating inflation, which in one way or another
would have to make stock equities preferable to bonds payable in a
fixed amount of dollars.* There is the alternative possibility—which we also consider highly unlikely—that American business
will become so profitable, without stepped-up inflation, as to jus-
tify a large increase in common-stock values in the next few years.Finally, there is the more familiar possibility that we shall witness
another great speculative rise in the stock market without a real
justification in the underlying values. Any of these reasons, andperhaps others we haven’t thought of, might cause the investor to
regret a 100% concentration on bonds even at their more favorable
yield levels.
Hence, after this foreshortened discussion of the major consider-
ations, we once again enunciate the same basic compromise policy26 The Intelligent Investor
* Since 1997 , when Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or TIPS) were
introduced, stocks have no longer been the automatically superior choice
for investors who expect inflation to increase. TIPS, unlike other bonds, rise
in value if the Consumer Price Index goes up, effectively immunizing theinvestor against losing money after inflation. Stocks carry no such guaranteeand, in fact, are a relatively poor hedge against high rates of inflation. (Formore details, see the commentary to Chapter 2.)

CHAPTER 8
The Investor and Market Fluctuations
To the extent that the investor’s funds are placed in high-grade
bonds of relatively short maturity—say, of seven years or less—he
will not be affected significantly by changes in market prices andneed not take them into account. (This applies also to his holdingsof U.S. savings bonds, which he can always turn in at his cost price
or more.) His longer-term bonds may have relatively wide price
swings during their lifetimes, and his common-stock portfolio isalmost certain to fluctuate in value over any period of several
years.
The investor should know about these possibilities and should
be prepared for them both financially and psychologically. He will
want to benefit from changes in market levels—certainly throughan advance in the value of his stock holdings as time goes on, andperhaps also by making purchases and sales at advantageous
prices. This interest on his part is inevitable, and legitimate
enough. But it involves the very real danger that it will lead himinto speculative attitudes and activities. It is easy for us to tell you
not to speculate; the hard thing will be for you to follow this
advice. Let us repeat what we said at the outset: If you want tospeculate do so with your eyes open, knowing that you will proba-
bly lose money in the end; be sure to limit the amount at risk and to
separate it completely from your investment program.
We shall deal first with the more important subject of price
changes in common stocks, and pass later to the area of bonds. In Chapter 3 we supplied a historical survey of the stock market’saction over the past hundred years. In this section we shall returnto that material from time to time, in order to see what the pastrecord promises the investor—in either the form of long-termappreciation of a portfolio held relatively unchanged through 
188

els. That was too good to be true. At long last the stock market has
“returned to normal,” in the sense that both speculators and stock
investors must again be prepared to experience significant and per-
haps protracted falls as well as rises in the value of their holdings.
In the area of many secondary and third-line common stocks,
especially recently floated enterprises, the havoc wrought by thelast market break was catastrophic. This was nothing new initself—it had happened to a similar degree in 1961–62—but there
was now a novel element in the fact that some of the investment
funds had large commitments in highly speculative and obviouslyovervalued issues of this type. Evidently it is not only the tyro who
needs to be warned that while enthusiasm may be necessary for
great accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invari-ably leads to disaster.
The major question we shall have to deal with grows out of the
huge rise in the rate of interest on first-quality bonds. Since late 1967the investor has been able to obtain more than twice as much
income from such bonds as he could from dividends on representa-
tive common stocks. At the beginning of 1972 the return was 7.19%on highest-grade bonds versus only 2.76% on industrial stocks.
(This compares with 4.40% and 2.92% respectively at the end of
1964.) It is hard to realize that when we first wrote this book in 1949the figures were almost the exact opposite: the bonds returned only
2.66% and the stocks yielded 6.82%.
2In previous editions we have
consistently urged that at least 25% of the conservative investor’s
portfolio be held in common stocks, and we have favored in generala 50–50 division between the two media. We must now considerwhether the current great advantage of bond yields over stock
yields would justify an all-bond policy until a more sensible rela-
tionship returns, as we expect it will. Naturally the question of con-tinued inflation will be of great importance in reaching our decision
here. A chapter will be devoted to this discussion.*What This Book Expects to Accomplish 5
* See Chapter 2. As of the beginning of 2003, U.S. Treasury bonds matur-
ing in 10 years yielded 3.8%, while stocks (as measured by the Dow JonesIndustrial Average) yielded 1.9%. (Note that this relationship is not all thatdifferent from the 1964 figures that Graham cites.) The income generatedby top-quality bonds has been falling steadily since 1981.

Question: As a beginner, should I invest in stocks or bonds? Why?
","As a beginner, investing in bonds may be a more suitable choice for you, primarily due to their relative stability and lower risk compared to stocks. Here are a few reasons why bonds could be a better option:

1. **Simplicity and Predictability**: Bonds, especially intermediate-term bonds, provide a more straightforward investment experience. They do not require you to guess the fluctuations of interest rates as much as stocks require you to predict market movements.

2. **Lower Risk**: Bonds generally offer more protection against loss compared to stocks. The interest and principal payments on good bonds are more certain, making them a safer investment, especially for those who are new to investing.

3. **Diversification**: If you have a limited amount to invest, bond funds can provide cheap and easy diversification, which helps mitigate the risk associated with individual bonds. This is particularly important for beginners who may not have enough capital to diversify effectively with individual bonds.

4. **Income Generation**: Bonds can provide a steady stream of income through interest payments, which can be reinvested or used as needed. This can be particularly appealing for beginners who may prefer a more passive investment approach.

5. **Less Emotional Stress**: Investing in stocks can lead to emotional stress due to market volatility. Bonds tend to have less price fluctuation, which can help you maintain a more stable investment experience.

In summary, as a beginner, focusing on bonds—especially through bond funds—can provide a more manageable, lower-risk investment strategy that allows you to build your understanding of investing without the added pressure of stock market volatility.",3.6312901973724365,"Human: Answer the following question based on this context:

• Are you single or married? What does your spouse or partner do
for a living?
• Do you or will you have children? When will the tuition bills hit
home?
• Will you inherit money, or will you end up financially responsible
for aging, ailing parents?
• What factors might hurt your career? (If you work for a bank or a
homebuilder, a jump in interest rates could put you out of a job. If
you work for a chemical manufacturer, soaring oil prices could bebad news.)
• If you are self-employed, how long do businesses similar to yours
tend to survive?
• Do you need your investments to supplement your cash income?
(In general, bonds will; stocks won’t.)
• Given your salary and your spending needs, how much money
can you afford to lose on your investments?
If, after considering these factors, you feel you can take the higher
risks inherent in greater ownership of stocks, you belong around
Graham’s minimum of 25% in bonds or cash. If not, then steer mostly
clear of stocks, edging toward Graham’s maximum of 75% in bondsor cash. (To find out whether you can go up to 100%, see the 
sidebar on p. 105.)
Once you set these target percentages, change them only as your
life circumstances change. Do not buy more stocks because the stockmarket has gone up; do not sell them because it has gone down. The
very heart of Graham’s approach is to replace guesswork with disci-pline. Fortunately, through your 401(k), it’s easy to put your portfolio
on permanent autopilot. Let’s say you are comfortable with a fairly high
level of risk—say, 70% of your assets in stocks and 30% in bonds. Ifthe stock market rises 25% (but bonds stay steady), you will now have
just under 75% in stocks and only 25% in bonds.
5Visit your 401(k)’s
website (or call its toll-free number) and sell enough of your stock
funds to “rebalance” back to your 70–30 target. The key is to rebal-ance on a predictable, patient schedule—not so often that you will104 Commentary on Chapter 4

neously.

THE INS AND OUTS OF INCOME INVESTING
In Graham’s day, bond investors faced two basic choices: Taxable or
tax-free? Short-term or long-term? Today there is a third: Bonds orbond funds?
Taxable or tax-free? Unless you’re in the lowest tax bracket,
6you
should buy only tax-free (municipal) bonds outside your retirementaccounts. Otherwise too much of your bond income will end up in thehands of the IRS. The only place to own taxable bonds is inside your401(k) or another sheltered account, where you will owe no currenttax on their income—and where municipal bonds have no place, since
their tax advantage goes to waste.
7
Short-term or long-term? Bonds and interest rates teeter on
opposite ends of a seesaw: If interest rates rise, bond prices fall—
although a short-term bond falls far less than a long-term bond. On theother hand, if interest rates fall, bond prices rise—and a long-termbond will outperform shorter ones.
8You can split the difference simply106 Commentary on Chapter 4
6For the 2003 tax year, the bottom Federal tax bracket is for single people
earning less than $28,400 or married people (filing jointly) earning less than
$47 ,450.
7Two good online calculators that will help you compare the after-tax in-
come of municipal and taxable bonds can be found at www.investinginbonds.com/cgi-bin/calculator.pl and www.lebenthal.com/index_infocenter.html. To
decide if a “muni” is right for you, find the “taxable equivalent yield” gener-ated by these calculators, then compare that number to the yield currently
available on Treasury bonds (http://money.cnn.com/markets/bondcenter/ or
www.bloomberg.com/markets/C13.html). If the yield on Treasury bonds ishigher than the taxable equivalent yield, munis are not for you. In any case,
be warned that municipal bonds and funds produce lower income, and
more price fluctuation, than most taxable bonds. Also, the alternative mini-mum tax, which now hits many middle-income Americans, can negate the
advantages of municipal bonds.

guard.com/web/planret/AdvicePTIBInvestmentsInvestingInBonds.html#Inter
estRates. For an even simpler explanation of bonds, see http://money.cnn.com/pf/101/lessons/7/. A “laddered” portfolio, holding bonds across a rangeof maturities, is another way of hedging interest-rate risk.

want to benefit from changes in market levels—certainly throughan advance in the value of his stock holdings as time goes on, andperhaps also by making purchases and sales at advantageous
prices. This interest on his part is inevitable, and legitimate
enough. But it involves the very real danger that it will lead himinto speculative attitudes and activities. It is easy for us to tell you
not to speculate; the hard thing will be for you to follow this
advice. Let us repeat what we said at the outset: If you want tospeculate do so with your eyes open, knowing that you will proba-
bly lose money in the end; be sure to limit the amount at risk and to
separate it completely from your investment program.
We shall deal first with the more important subject of price
changes in common stocks, and pass later to the area of bonds. In Chapter 3 we supplied a historical survey of the stock market’saction over the past hundred years. In this section we shall returnto that material from time to time, in order to see what the pastrecord promises the investor—in either the form of long-termappreciation of a portfolio held relatively unchanged through

As we have seen in Chapter 3, stocks are (as of early 2003) only
mildly overpriced by historical standards. Meanwhile, at recent prices,
bonds offer such low yields that an investor who buys them for theirsupposed safety is like a smoker who thinks he can protect himselfagainst lung cancer by smoking low-tar cigarettes. No matter how
defensive an investor you are—in Graham’s sense of low maintenance,or in the contemporary sense of low risk—today’s values mean that you
must keep at least some of your money in stocks.
Fortunately, it’s never been easier for a defensive investor to buy
stocks. And a permanent autopilot portfolio, which effortlessly puts a
little bit of your money to work every month in predetermined invest-ments, can defend you against the need to dedicate a large part ofyour life to stock picking.
SHOULD YOU “BUY WHAT YOU KNOW”?
But first, let’s look at something the defensive investor must always
defend against: the belief that you can pick stocks without doing anyhomework. In the 1980s and early 1990s, one of the most popular
investing slogans was “buy what you know. ” Peter Lynch—who from
1977 through 1990 piloted Fidelity Magellan to the best track recordever compiled by a mutual fund—was the most charismatic preacher of
this gospel. Lynch argued that amateur investors have an advantage
that professional investors have forgotten how to use: “the power ofcommon knowledge. ” If you discover a great new restaurant, car,
toothpaste, or jeans—or if you notice that the parking lot at a nearby
business is always full or that people are still working at a company’sheadquarters long after Jay Leno goes off the air—then you have a per-
sonal insight into a stock that a professional analyst or portfolio man-
ager might never pick up on. As Lynch put it, “During a lifetime ofbuying cars or cameras, you develop a sense of what’s good and
what’s bad, what sells and what doesn’t . . . and the most important
part is, you know it before Wall Street knows it. ”

Question: As a beginner, should I invest in stocks or bonds? Why?
","As a beginner, the decision to invest in stocks or bonds largely depends on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and personal circumstances. Based on the context provided, here are some considerations:

1. **Risk Tolerance**: If you are risk-averse and prefer more stable and predictable returns, bonds may be a better choice. Bonds typically offer more certainty in terms of interest and principal payments compared to stocks, which can be more volatile and subject to market fluctuations.

2. **Investment Goals**: If you need your investments to supplement your cash income, bonds are generally more suitable, as they provide regular interest payments. Stocks, on the other hand, do not guarantee dividends and can fluctuate in value, making them less reliable for immediate income needs.

3. **Market Conditions**: The context suggests that, as of late 1971, bonds appeared preferable to stocks due to their more favorable yield relationship. However, it also acknowledges the potential for inflation and other factors that could make stocks more attractive in the future. 

4. **Long-Term Perspective**: If you are willing to accept higher risks for the potential of greater long-term returns, you might consider allocating a portion of your investments to stocks. A balanced approach, such as Graham's recommendation of having at least 25% in bonds or cash, could provide a compromise between safety and growth.

5. **Personal Circumstances**: Consider your life situation, such as whether you have dependents, your job stability, and any upcoming financial obligations (like tuition bills). These factors can influence your ability to take risks with your investments.

In summary, if you prefer stability and predictable returns, start with bonds. If you are open to taking risks for potentially higher returns and can handle market fluctuations, consider including stocks in your portfolio. A balanced approach that reflects your personal circumstances and risk tolerance is often advisable.",7.111032009124756

Rarely does one find a brokerage-house study that points out, 
with a convincing array of facts, that a popular industry is head-
ing for a fall or that an unpopular one is due to prosper. Wall
Street’s view of the longer future is notoriously fallible, and thisnecessarily applies to that important part of its investigationswhich is directed toward the forecasting of the course of profits invarious industries.
We must recognize, however, that the rapid and pervasive
growth of technology in recent years is not without major effect onthe attitude and the labors of the security analyst. More so than inthe past, the progress or retrogression of the typical company in the
coming decade may depend on its relation to new products and
new processes, which the analyst may have a chance to study andevaluate in advance. Thus there is doubtless a promising area for
effective work by the analyst, based on field trips, interviews with
research men, and on intensive technological investigation on his
own. There are hazards connected with investment conclusions
derived chiefly from such glimpses into the future, and not sup-
ported by presently demonstrable value. Yet there are perhapsequal hazards in sticking closely to the limits of value set by sober
calculations resting on actual results. The investor cannot have it
both ways. He can be imaginative and play for the big profits thatare the reward for vision proved sound by the event; but then he
must run a substantial risk of major or minor miscalculation. Or he
can be conservative, and refuse to pay more than a minor premiumfor possibilities as yet unproved; but in that case he must be pre-
pared for the later contemplation of golden opportunities foregone.
A Two-Part Appraisal Process
Let us return for a moment to the idea of valuation or appraisal
of a common stock, which we began to discuss above on p. 288. Agreat deal of reflection on the subject has led us to conclude that
this better be done quite differently than is now the establishedpractice. We suggest that analysts work out first what we call the“past-performance value,” which is based solely on the pastrecord. This would indicate what the stock would be worth—absolutely, or as a percentage of the DJIA or of the S & P compos-ite—if it is assumed that its relative past performance will continueSecurity Analysis for the Lay Investor 299

THE RISK IS NOT IN OUR STOCKS, 
BUT IN OURSELVES
Risk exists in another dimension: inside you. If you overestimate 
how well you really understand an investment, or overstate your abilityto ride out a temporary plunge in prices, it doesn’t matter what you
own or how the market does. Ultimately, financial risk resides not in
what kinds of investments you have, but in what kind of investor you
are. If you want to know what risk really is, go to the nearest bathroomand step up to the mirror. That’s risk, gazing back at you from the
glass.
As you look at yourself in the mirror, what should you watch for?
The Nobel-prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains twofactors that characterize good decisions:
•“well-calibrated confidence” (do I understand this investment as
well as I think I do?)
•“correctly-anticipated regret” (how will I react if my analysis
turns out to be wrong?).
To find out whether your confidence is well-calibrated, look in the
mirror and ask yourself: “What is the likelihood that my analysis is
right?” Think carefully through these questions:
• How much experience do I have? What is my track record with
similar decisions in the past?
• What is the typical track record of other people who have tried
this in the past?

• If I am buying, someone else is selling. How likely is it that I know
something that this other person (or company) does not know?
• If I am selling, someone else is buying. How likely is it that I know

These questions can also help you determine whether the people
who run the company will act in the interests of the people who own
the company:
• Are they looking out for No. 1?
A firm that pays its CEO $100 million in a year had better have a
very good reason. (Perhaps he discovered—and patented—the Foun-
tain of Youth? Or found El Dorado and bought it for $1 an acre? Or
contacted life on another planet and negotiated a contract obligat-
ing the aliens to buy all their supplies from only one company onEarth?) Otherwise, this kind of obscenely obese payday suggests
that the firm is run by the managers, forthe managers.
If a company reprices (or “reissues” or “exchanges”) its stock
options for insiders, stay away. In this switcheroo, a company can-
cels existing (and typically worthless) stock options for employeesand executives, then replaces them with new ones at advanta-geous prices. If their value is never allowed to go to zero, while
their potential profit is always infinite, how can options encourage
good stewardship of corporate assets? Any established companythat reprices options—as dozens of high-tech firms have—is a dis-
grace. And any investor who buys stock in such a company is a
sheep begging to be sheared.
By looking in the annual report for the mandatory footnote
about stock options, you can see how large the “option overhang”is. AOL Time Warner, for example, reported in the front of itsannual report that it had 4.5 billion shares of common stock out-
standing as of December 31, 2002—but a footnote in the bowels
of the report reveals that the company had issued options on 657million more shares. So AOL’s future earnings will have to be
divided among 15% more shares. You should factor in the poten-
tial flood of new shares from stock options whenever you estimatea company’s future value.

A Better Way to Measure Performance
When the price of a stock can be influenced by a ""herd"" on Wall Street with prices set at the margin by the most emotional person, or the greediest person, or the most depressed person, it is hard to argue that the market always prices rationally. In fact, market prices are frequently nonsensical.
—Warren Buffett
If Buffett is right—if market prices are frequently nonsensical—then we are foolish indeed to use 
price as a sole indicator of performance. Yet we do. Our entire industry is price-myopic. If the price of a particular stock is going up, we assume good things are happening; if the price starts to go down, we assume something bad is happening, and we act accordingly. But if prices are not always completely rational, are we being completely rational when we base our actions on their ups and downs?
  

Question: How do I evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued?
","To evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued, you can follow these steps:

1. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Calculate the P/E ratio of the stock and compare it to the industry average or historical averages. A significantly higher P/E ratio may indicate overvaluation, while a lower ratio could suggest undervaluation.

2. **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: Look at the price-to-book ratio. A P/B ratio of less than 2.5 is often considered reasonable. If the ratio is significantly higher, it may indicate that the stock is overvalued.

3. **Graham's Blended Multiplier**: Use Benjamin Graham's suggestion to multiply the P/E ratio by the P/B ratio. If the resulting number is below 22.5, it may indicate that the stock is reasonably priced. If it is above this threshold, the stock could be overvalued.

4. **Past Performance Value**: Assess the company's past performance to determine its historical value. This involves analyzing financial statements and performance metrics over at least five years to gauge whether the stock's current price reflects its historical performance.

5. **Market Sentiment and Institutional Ownership**: Check the percentage of shares owned by institutions. If over 60% of shares are held by institutions, it may indicate that the stock is widely owned and potentially overvalued. Additionally, consider market sentiment and whether the stock price is influenced by emotional trading rather than fundamentals.

6. **Management Practices**: Investigate the company's management practices, including executive compensation and stock option policies. Excessive pay or stock option repricing can indicate misalignment of management interests with those of shareholders, which may affect the stock's valuation.

7. **Technological and Industry Trends**: Consider the company's position in relation to technological advancements and industry trends. A company that is well-positioned for future growth may be undervalued, while one that is lagging may be overvalued.

8. **Self-Assessment**: Reflect on your own understanding and confidence in the investment. Evaluate your experience and track record, and consider how likely it is that you know something that others do not.

By combining these methods, you can form a more comprehensive view of whether a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued.",30.13443112373352,"Human: Answer the following question based on this context:

having courage in depressed markets is vindicated not only by the
voice of experience but also by application of plausible techniques
of value analysis.
The same vagaries of the market place that recurrently establish
a bargain condition in the general list account for the existence ofmany individual bargains at almost all market levels. The market isfond of making mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordi-
nary vicissitudes into major setbacks.* Even a mere lack of interest
or enthusiasm may impel a price decline to absurdly low levels.Thus we have what appear to be two major sources of undervalua-
tion: (1) currently disappointing results and (2) protracted neglect
or unpopularity.
However, neither of these causes, if considered by itself alone,
can be relied on as a guide to successful common-stock investment.
How can we be sure that the currently disappointing results are
indeed going to be only temporary? True, we can supply excellent
examples of that happening. The steel stocks used to be famous 
for their cyclical quality, and the shrewd buyer could acquire them at low prices when earnings were low and sell them out in
boom years at a fine profit. A spectacular example is supplied by
Chrysler Corporation, as shown by the data in Table 7-3.
If this were the standard behavior of stocks with fluctuating
earnings, then making profits in the stock market would be an easymatter. Unfortunately, we could cite many examples of declines inPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side 167
* Among the steepest of the mountains recently made out of molehills: 
In May 1998, Pfizer Inc. and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
announced that six men taking Pfizer’s anti-impotence drug Viagra had died
of heart attacks while having sex. Pfizer’s stock immediately went flaccid,losing 3.4% in a single day on heavy trading. But Pfizer’s shares surged
ahead when research later showed that there was no cause for alarm; the
stock gained roughly a third over the next two years. In late 1997 , shares ofWarner-Lambert Co. fell by 19% in a day when sales of its new diabetesdrug were temporarily halted in England; within six months, the stock hadnearly doubled. In late 2002, Carnival Corp., which operates cruise ships,lost roughly 10% of its value after tourists came down with severe diarrheaand vomiting—on ships run by other companies.

Any portfolio that outperforms over any length of time does so because it contains mispriced securities. The 
market was wrong about the future of that aggregate. We look directly for mispricings by comparing what the market says a company is worth with what we believe it is worth using a multifactor methodology.
This methodology starts with the accounting-based stuff and moves through private market value analysis, leveraged buyout analysis, looking at liquidating value, and of course involves a discounted cash flow model.
Valuation is a dynamic not a static process. When we first valued AOL it was trading in the mid-teens; we believed the business was worth $30 or so. We now value the business at $110 on the low end to $175, based on what we think is a conservative discounted cash flow. If we are right about the long-term economic model, the number could be much higher.
No one complains when we're loaded with General Motors or Chase—good, old, easy-to-understand values—or when we're buying perpetual dogs like Toys ""R"" Us or Western Digital in the midst of massive losses. It's the Dells and AOLs people object to.
And what they seem to object to most is that we didn't sell Dell at $8 like other value guys did because historically PC stocks traded between 6 and 12x earnings, so when Dell hit 12x it must no longer be a value.
We are delighted when people use simple-minded, accounting-based metrics and then align them on a linear scale and then use that to make buy-and-sell decisions. It's much easier than actually doing the work to figure out what the business is worth, and it enables us to generate better results for our clients by doing more thorough analysis.
We own GM and AOL for the same reason: The market is wrong about the price because both companies trade at discounts to the intrinsic value of the underlying business.

Question: How do I evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued?
","To evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued, you can follow these steps:

1. **Compare Market Value to Intrinsic Value**: Use a multifactor methodology to assess what you believe the company is worth compared to its current market price. This involves various valuation techniques such as:
   - **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Analyze the P/E ratio in relation to historical averages and industry benchmarks.
   - **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: Look at the P/B ratio and consider Graham's suggestion of multiplying the P/E ratio by the P/B ratio to see if the resulting number is below 22.5, which can indicate reasonable pricing.

2. **Conduct Value Analysis**: Utilize accounting-based metrics, private market value analysis, leveraged buyout analysis, and discounted cash flow models to derive a more comprehensive view of the company's value.

3. **Assess Market Sentiment**: Recognize that market prices can be influenced by emotional reactions and may not reflect the company's true value. Look for instances where the market has overreacted to news or events, leading to price declines that may not be justified by the company's fundamentals.

4. **Evaluate Earnings Cycles**: Consider the cyclical nature of the company's earnings. Historical examples, such as steel stocks or Chrysler Corporation, can illustrate how low earnings can lead to undervaluation, but also how these conditions can be temporary.

5. **Perform Due Diligence**: Review the company's financial statements, including annual and quarterly reports, to understand its financial health over time. Look for trends in revenue, profit margins, and cash flow.

6. **Check Institutional Ownership**: Analyze the percentage of shares owned by institutions. A high percentage (over 60%) may indicate that the stock is well-known and possibly overowned, which could lead to volatility if institutions decide to sell.

7. **Examine Management Practices**: Investigate the company's management compensation and practices, such as stock option repricing. Excessive pay without justification or practices that favor insiders can be red flags.

8. **Monitor Market Conditions**: Be aware of broader market trends and economic conditions that may affect the stock's valuation. 

By combining these approaches, you can form a more informed opinion on whether a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued.",19.294036865234375,"Human: Answer the following question based on this context:

proper calculation of intrinsic valuation, not the end. The list of additional
factors he examines is seemingly endless and includes such things as the
current and prospective regulatory climate; state of labor , supplier , and
customer relations; potential impact of changes in technology; competitive

issues; and, notably , the presence of hidden exposures (Charlie knows that

management well beyond conventional number crunching-in particular , the
degree to which they are ""able, trustworthy , and owner -oriented."" For
example, how do they deploy cash? Do they allocate it intelligently on
behalf of the owners, or do they overcompensate themselves, or pursue ego-
oriented growth for growth's sake? Above all, he attempts to assess and
understand competitive advantage in every respect-products, markets,

The Relatively Unpopular Large Company
If we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue com-
mon stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are
glamorous for some other reason, it is logical to expect that it willundervalue—relatively, at least—companies that are out of favorbecause of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature.This may be set down as a fundamental law of the stock market,and it suggests an investment approach that should prove both
conservative and promising.
The key requirement here is that the enterprising investor 
concentrate on the larger companies that are going through aperiod of unpopularity. While small companies may also be 
undervalued for similar reasons, and in many cases may laterincrease their earnings and share price, they entail the risk of adefinitive loss of profitability and also of protracted neglect by the market in spite of better earnings. The large companies thushave a double advantage over the others. First, they have the
resources in capital and brain power to carry them through adver-
sity and back to a satisfactory earnings base. Second, the market islikely to respond with reasonable speed to any improvementshown.
A remarkable demonstration of the soundness of this thesis is
found in studies of the price behavior of the unpopular issues in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In these it was assumed that an
investment was made each year in either the six or the ten issues in the DJIA which were selling at the lowest multipliers of their
current or previous year’s earnings. These could be called the
“cheapest” stocks in the list, and their cheapness was evidently thereflection of relative unpopularity with investors or traders. It was
assumed further that these purchases were sold out at the end of
holding periods ranging from one to five years. The results of these
investments were then compared with the results shown in either
the DJIA as a whole or in the highest multiplier (i.e., the most pop-ular) group.
The detailed material we have available covers the results of
annual purchases assumed in each of the past 53 years.

period, 1917–1933, this approach proved unprofitable. But since1933 the method has shown highly successful results. In 34 testsPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side 163

other hand, the common-stock investor holds a piece of paper, an
engraved stock certificate, which can be sold in a matter of minutes
at a price which varies from moment to moment—when the mar-
ket is open, that is—and often is far removed from the balance-sheet value.*
The development of the stock market in recent decades has
made the typical investor more dependent on the course of pricequotations and less free than formerly to consider himself merely a
business owner. The reason is that the successful enterprises in
which he is likely to concentrate his holdings sell almost constantlyat prices well above their net asset value (or book value, or 
“balance-sheet value”). In paying these market premiums the
investor gives precious hostages to fortune, for he must depend onthe stock market itself to validate his commitments.†
This is a factor of prime importance in present-day investing,
and it has received less attention than it deserves. The whole struc-ture of stock-market quotations contains a built-in contradiction.
The better a company’s record and prospects, the less relationship
the price of its shares will have to their book value. But the greaterthe premium above book value, the less certain the basis of deter-
mining its intrinsic value—i.e., the more this “value” will depend
on the changing moods and measurements of the stock market.Thus we reach the final paradox, that the more successful the com-
pany, the greater are likely to be the fluctuations in the price of its
shares. This really means that, in a very real sense, the better the198 The Intelligent Investor
* Most companies today provide “an engraved stock certificate” only upon
special request. Stocks exist, for the most part, in purely electronic form

actual currency) and thus have become even easier to trade than they werein Graham’s day.

are all synonyms for net worth, or the total value of a company’s physicaland financial assets minus all its liabilities. It can be calculated using the bal-ance sheets in a company’s annual and quarterly reports; from total share-holders’ equity, subtract all “soft” assets such as goodwill, trademarks, andother intangibles.

unchanged in the future. (This includes the assumption that its rel-
ative growth rate, as shown in the last seven years, will also con-
tinue unchanged over the next seven years.) This process could be
carried out mechanically by applying a formula that gives individ-ual weights to past figures for profitability, stability, and growth,and also for current financial condition. The second part of theanalysis should consider to what extent the value based solely onpast performance should be modified because of new conditions
expected in the future.
Such a procedure would divide the work between senior and
junior analysts as follows: (1) The senior analyst would set up theformula to apply to all companies generally for determining past-
performance value. (2) The junior analysts would work up suchfactors for the designated companies—pretty much in mechanicalfashion. (3) The senior analyst would then determine to whatextent a company’s performance—absolute or relative—is likely todiffer from its past record, and what change should be made in 
the value to reflect such anticipated changes. It would be best if the
senior analyst’s report showed both the original valuation and themodified one, with his reasons for the change.
Is a job of this kind worth doing? Our answer is in the affirma-
tive, but our reasons may appear somewhat cynical to the reader.We doubt whether the valuations so reached will prove sufficiently
dependable in the case of the typical industrial company, great or
small. We shall illustrate the difficulties of this job in our discus-sion of Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) in the next
chapter. Nonetheless it should be done for such common stocks.Why? First, many security analysts are bound to make current or
projected valuations, as part of their daily work. The method we
propose should be an improvement on those generally followed
today. Secondly, because it should give useful experience andinsight to the analysts who practice this method. Thirdly, because
work of this kind could produce an invaluable body of recorded
experience—as has long been the case in medicine—that may leadto better methods of procedure and a useful knowledge of its pos-sibilities and limitations. The public-utility stocks might wellprove an important area in which this approach will show realpragmatic value. Eventually the intelligent analyst will confinehimself to those groups in which the future appears reasonably300 The Intelligent Investor

you early-warning signals of eventual financial performance. If you look closely at the words and 
actions of a management team, you will find clues for measuring the value of their work long before it shows up in the company's financial reports or in the stock pages of your daily newspaper. Finding the clues will take some digging, and that news may be enough to discourage the weak of heart or the lazy. Their discouragement is your gain.
If the idea of measuring management still seems vague, Buffett offers a few tips:• Review annual reports from a few years back, paying special attention to what management said 
then about strategies for the future.
• Compare those plans to today's results: How fully were they realized?
• Compare the strategies of a few years ago to this year's strategies and ideas: How has the thinking 
changed?
• Compare the annual reports of the company you are interested in with reports from similar 
companies in the same industry. It is not always easy to find exact duplicates, but even relative performance comparison can yield insights.
A focus investor is ideally suited to the task of measuring management. Someone who owns just a 
few companies and plans to own them for several years has a real opportunity to get to know management. Track through earlier annual reports and begin to develop a sense of the management's history. Follow your companies in the press; read what management says and what others say about them. If you notice that the CEO recently made a speech or presentation, get a copy from the investor relations department and read it carefully. Search the companies' Web pages for up-to-the-minute information. In every way you can think of, raise your antennae. The important point is: Do not dismiss the premise about valuing management because the task is not simple. The
  

Question: How do I evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued?
","To evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued, you can follow these steps:

1. **Intrinsic Valuation**: Start with a proper calculation of the intrinsic value of the stock. This involves analyzing financial statements to determine the actual free cash flow, working capital assets, fixed assets, and liabilities. Adjust for any overstated intangible assets like goodwill.

2. **Assess Competitive Advantage**: Evaluate the company's competitive strengths and vulnerabilities, often referred to as its ""moat."" A strong moat indicates a durable competitive advantage, which can justify a higher valuation.

3. **Market Sentiment**: Consider the current market sentiment towards the company. Stocks that are out of favor due to temporary issues may be undervalued, while those that are popular may be overvalued.

4. **Historical Performance**: Review the company's historical performance and compare it to its current valuation. Look for discrepancies between past earnings growth and current stock price.

5. **Management Evaluation**: Analyze the management's track record in terms of capital allocation, strategic decisions, and their ability to execute plans. Compare past management strategies with current results to gauge effectiveness.

6. **Industry Comparison**: Compare the company's valuation metrics (like P/E ratio, P/B ratio) with those of similar companies in the same industry. This can provide context for whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to peers.

7. **Future Prospects**: Consider the potential impact of future changes in technology, regulation, and market conditions on the company's earnings. Adjust your valuation based on expected future performance.

8. **Market Premiums**: Be aware that successful companies often trade at a premium to their book value. Understand that a high premium can indicate overvaluation, especially if the company's growth prospects do not justify it.

By combining these analyses, you can form a more comprehensive view of whether a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued.",8.942396879196167
