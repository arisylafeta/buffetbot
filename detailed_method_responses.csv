Bonds or bond funds? Since bonds are generally sold in $10,000
lots and you need a bare minimum of 10 bonds to diversify away therisk that any one of them might go bust, buying individual bonds
makes no sense unless you have at least $100,000 to invest. (Theonly exception is bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, since they’re pro-
tected against default by the full force of the American government.)
Bond funds offer cheap and easy diversification, along with the
convenience of monthly income, which you can reinvest right back into
the fund at current rates without paying a commission. For mostinvestors, bond funds beat individual bonds hands down (the mainexceptions are Treasury securities and some municipal bonds). Major
firms like Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, and T. Rowe Price offer a broad
menu of bond funds at low cost.

of these .400 hitters. As Buffett once said, ""The key to life is to figure out who to be the batboy for."" 
4
Think of Stocks as Businesses
""In our view,"" says Buffett, ""investment students need only two well-taught courses—How to Value 
a Business, and How to Think About Market Prices.""5
The necessary first step for anyone who wants to emulate Warren Buffett's approach is to think about 
stocks first and foremost as businesses. ""Whenever Charlie and I buy common stocks for Berkshire, we approach the transaction as if we were buying into a private business. We look at the economic 
prospects of the business, the people in charge of running it, and the price we must pay.""
6 The 
specifics of what he looks for are presented in the Warren Buffett Way investment tenets, which you 
will find summarized in Chapter 1.
""Your goal as an investor should be simply to purchase, at a rational price, a part interest in an easily 
understandable business whose earnings are virtually certain to be materially higher, five, ten, and twenty years from now,"" explains Buffett. ""Over time, you will find only a few companies that meet 
these standards—so when you see one that qualifies, you should buy a meaningful amount of stock.""
7
Increase the Size of Your Investment
""I wouldn't want to buy anything where I wouldn't want to put 10 percent of my net worth into it,"" 
confesses Buffett. ""If I don't want to put that into it, then it just isn't much of an idea."" (OID)8
How many stocks should an investor own? Buffett would tell you it depends on your investment 
approach. If you have the
  

approach is up your alley. If you always feel rushed, crave simplicity,
and don’t relish thinking about money, then the passive approach is foryou. (Some people will feel most comfortable combining both meth-ods—creating a portfolio that is mainly active and partly passive, orvice versa.)
Both approaches are equally intelligent, and you can be successful
with either—but only if you know yourself well enough to pick the rightone, stick with it over the course of your investing lifetime, and keep
your costs and emotions under control. Graham’s distinction betweenactive and passive investors is another of his reminders that financial
risk lies not only where most of us look for it—in the economy or in ourinvestments—but also within ourselves.
CAN YOU BE BRAVE, OR WILL YOU CAVE?
How, then, should a defensive investor get started? The first and most
basic decision is how much to put in stocks and how much to put inbonds and cash. (Note that Graham deliberately places this discus-
sion after his chapter on inflation, forearming you with the knowledge
that inflation is one of your worst enemies.)
The most striking thing about Graham’s discussion of how to allo-
cate your assets between stocks and bonds is that he never mentionsthe word “age. ” That sets his advice firmly against the winds of con-
ventional wisdom—which holds that how much investing risk you oughtto take depends mainly on how old you are.
2A traditional rule of thumb
was to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of yourassets in stocks, with the rest in bonds or cash. (A 28-year-old wouldput 72% of her money in stocks; an 81-year-old would put only 19%
there.) Like everything else, these assumptions got overheated in the
late 1990s. By 1999, a popular book argued that if you were youngerthan 30 you should put 95% of your money in stocks—even if you had
only a “moderate” tolerance for risk!

up more than 30,000 online references.

two main points. The first was that they had offered a considerable
degree of protection against the erosion of the investor’s dollar
caused by inflation, whereas bonds offered no protection at all. The
second advantage of common stocks lay in their higher averagereturn to investors over the years. This was produced both by anaverage dividend income exceeding the yield on good bonds andby an underlying tendency for market value to increase over theyears in consequence of the reinvestment of undistributed profits.
While these two advantages have been of major importance—
and have given common stocks a far better record than bonds over the long-term past—we have consistently warned that these
benefits could be lost by the stock buyer if he pays too high a price
for his shares. This was clearly the case in 1929, and it took 25 yearsfor the market level to climb back to the ledge from which it had abysmally fallen in 1929–1932.* Since 1957 common stockshave once again, through their high prices, lost their traditionaladvantage in dividend yield over bond interest rates.† It remains toThe Defensive Investor and Common Stocks 113
* The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a then-record high of 381.17
on September 3, 1929. It did not close above that level until November 23,
1954—more than a quarter of a century later—when it hit 382.74. (When you
say you intend to own stocks “for the long run, ” do you realize just how longthe long run can be—or that many investors who bought in 1929 were no
longer even alive by 1954?) However, for patient investors who reinvested
their income, stock returns were positive over this otherwise dismal period,simply because dividend yields averaged more than 5.6% per year. Accord-
ing to professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton of London
Business School, if you had invested $1 in U.S. stocks in 1900 and spentall your dividends, your stock portfolio would have grown to $198 by 2000.But if you had reinvested all your dividends, your stock portfolio would have
been worth $16,797! Far from being an afterthought, dividends are the
greatest force in stock investing.† Why do the “high prices” of stocks affect their dividend yields? A stock’s
yield is the ratio of its cash dividend to the price of one share of common
stock. If a company pays a $2 annual dividend when its stock price is $100per share, its yield is 2%. But if the stock price doubles while the dividendstays constant, the dividend yield will drop to 1%. In 1959, when the trendGraham spotted in 1957 became noticeable to everyone, most Wall Street

have practiced using a ledger of hypothetical buys and sells on a 
legal pad; nowadays, you can use “portfolio trackers” at websites likewww.morningstar.com, http://finance.yahoo.com, http://money.cnn.com/services/portfolio/ or www.marketocracy.com (at the last site,ignore the “market-beating” hype on its funds and other services).
By test-driving your techniques before trying them with real money,
you can make mistakes without incurring any actual losses, developthe discipline to avoid frequent trading, compare your approach
against those of leading money managers, and learn what works foryou. Best of all, tracking the outcome of all your stock picks will pre-
vent you from forgetting that some of your hunches turn out to bestinkers. That will force you to learn from your winners andyour losers.
After a year, measure your results against how you would have done if
you had put all your money in an S & P 500 index fund. If you didn’tenjoy the experiment or your picks were poor, no harm done—selectingindividual stocks is not for you. Get yourself an index fund and stop
wasting your time on stock picking.
If you enjoyed the experiment and earned sufficiently good returns,
gradually assemble a basket of stocks—but limit it to a maximum of10% of your overall portfolio (keep the rest in an index fund). And
remember, you can always stop if it no longer interests you or yourreturns turn bad.
LOOKING UNDER THE RIGHT ROCKS
So how should you go about looking for a potentially rewarding
stock? You can use websites like http://finance.yahoo.com andwww.morningstar.com to screen stocks with the statistical filters sug-
gested in Chapter 14. Or you can take a more patient, craftsmanlike
approach. Unlike most people, many of the best professional investorsfirst get interested in a company when its share price goes down, not
up. Christopher Browne of Tweedy Browne Global Value Fund,
William Nygren of the Oakmark Fund, Robert Rodriguez of FPA Capi-tal Fund, and Robert Torray of the Torray Fund all suggest looking at
the daily list of new 52-week lows in the Wall Street Journal or the
similar table in the “Market Week” section of Barron’s. That will point
you toward stocks and industries that are unfashionable or unloved
and that thus offer the potential for high returns once perceptionschange.

Question: As a beginner, should I invest in stocks or bonds? Why?
","As a beginner, investing in bonds may be a more suitable choice than stocks for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity and Predictability**: Bonds, particularly intermediate-term bonds, provide a simpler investment option that does not require you to guess future interest rates. They tend to offer more predictable returns compared to stocks, which can be volatile and influenced by various market factors.

2. **Diversification**: If you are considering individual bonds, you typically need a significant amount of capital (at least $100,000) to diversify effectively. However, bond funds offer an easy way to achieve diversification with lower investment amounts, reducing the risk associated with any single bond defaulting.

3. **Income Generation**: Bond funds provide the convenience of monthly income, which can be reinvested without incurring commissions. This can be particularly appealing for beginners looking for steady cash flow.

4. **Lower Risk**: Bonds, especially those issued by the U.S. Treasury, are generally considered safer investments compared to stocks. They are less likely to experience drastic price fluctuations, making them a more stable option for new investors.

5. **Understanding Your Risk Tolerance**: As a beginner, it’s essential to assess your risk tolerance. Bonds are typically less risky than stocks, making them a better fit for those who may not be comfortable with the potential for significant losses associated with stock investments.

In summary, for a beginner, bonds or bond funds can provide a more straightforward, lower-risk investment option that allows for income generation and diversification without the complexities and volatility of the stock market.",2.599050998687744,"Human: Answer the following question based on this context:

Question: As a beginner, should I invest in stocks or bonds? Why?
","As a beginner, the decision to invest in stocks or bonds depends on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Here are some considerations based on the context provided:

1. **Understanding Risk**: Stocks are generally considered riskier than bonds, as they can be more volatile and subject to market fluctuations. However, they also offer the potential for higher returns over the long term. Bonds, on the other hand, tend to provide more stability and regular income, making them a safer choice for conservative investors.

2. **Investment Goals**: If you are looking for long-term growth and can tolerate some risk, investing in stocks may be more suitable. Warren Buffett emphasizes thinking of stocks as businesses and suggests investing in companies with strong economic prospects. Conversely, if you need more immediate income or are risk-averse, bonds might be a better option.

3. **Diversification**: A balanced approach could involve investing in both stocks and bonds. This strategy can help mitigate risk while still allowing for growth potential. Graham suggests keeping a minimum of 25% in bonds to provide a cushion during market downturns, which can help you maintain your investment strategy even when stocks are performing poorly.

4. **Personal Circumstances**: Your age, financial situation, and future needs should also influence your decision. For example, a younger investor might lean more towards stocks for growth, while someone closer to retirement might prioritize bonds for income and stability.

In summary, as a beginner, consider your risk tolerance, investment goals, and personal circumstances. A diversified approach that includes both stocks and bonds may provide a balanced way to start investing.",4.433095932006836,"Human: Answer the following question based on this context:

of the fact that the interest and principal payments on good bonds
are much better protected and therefore more certain than the divi-
dends and price appreciation on stocks. Consequently we are
forced to the conclusion that now, toward the end of 1971, bondinvestment appears clearly preferable to stock investment. If wecould be sure that this conclusion is right we would have to advisethe defensive investor to put allhis money in bonds and none in
common stocks until the current yield relationship changes signifi-
cantly in favor of stocks.
But of course we cannot be certain that bonds will work out bet-
ter than stocks from today’s levels. The reader will immediatelythink of the inflation factor as a potent reason on the other side. In
the next chapter we shall argue that our considerable experiencewith inflation in the United States during this century would notsupport the choice of stocks against bonds at present differentialsin yield. But there is always the possibility—though we consider itremote—of an accelerating inflation, which in one way or another
would have to make stock equities preferable to bonds payable in a
fixed amount of dollars.* There is the alternative possibility—which we also consider highly unlikely—that American business
will become so profitable, without stepped-up inflation, as to jus-
tify a large increase in common-stock values in the next few years.Finally, there is the more familiar possibility that we shall witness
another great speculative rise in the stock market without a real
justification in the underlying values. Any of these reasons, andperhaps others we haven’t thought of, might cause the investor to
regret a 100% concentration on bonds even at their more favorable
yield levels.
Hence, after this foreshortened discussion of the major consider-
ations, we once again enunciate the same basic compromise policy26 The Intelligent Investor
* Since 1997 , when Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or TIPS) were
introduced, stocks have no longer been the automatically superior choice
for investors who expect inflation to increase. TIPS, unlike other bonds, rise
in value if the Consumer Price Index goes up, effectively immunizing theinvestor against losing money after inflation. Stocks carry no such guaranteeand, in fact, are a relatively poor hedge against high rates of inflation. (Formore details, see the commentary to Chapter 2.)

• Are you single or married? What does your spouse or partner do
for a living?
• Do you or will you have children? When will the tuition bills hit
home?
• Will you inherit money, or will you end up financially responsible
for aging, ailing parents?
• What factors might hurt your career? (If you work for a bank or a
homebuilder, a jump in interest rates could put you out of a job. If
you work for a chemical manufacturer, soaring oil prices could bebad news.)
• If you are self-employed, how long do businesses similar to yours
tend to survive?
• Do you need your investments to supplement your cash income?
(In general, bonds will; stocks won’t.)
• Given your salary and your spending needs, how much money
can you afford to lose on your investments?
If, after considering these factors, you feel you can take the higher
risks inherent in greater ownership of stocks, you belong around
Graham’s minimum of 25% in bonds or cash. If not, then steer mostly
clear of stocks, edging toward Graham’s maximum of 75% in bondsor cash. (To find out whether you can go up to 100%, see the 
sidebar on p. 105.)
Once you set these target percentages, change them only as your
life circumstances change. Do not buy more stocks because the stockmarket has gone up; do not sell them because it has gone down. The
very heart of Graham’s approach is to replace guesswork with disci-pline. Fortunately, through your 401(k), it’s easy to put your portfolio
on permanent autopilot. Let’s say you are comfortable with a fairly high
level of risk—say, 70% of your assets in stocks and 30% in bonds. Ifthe stock market rises 25% (but bonds stay steady), you will now have
just under 75% in stocks and only 25% in bonds.
5Visit your 401(k)’s
website (or call its toll-free number) and sell enough of your stock
funds to “rebalance” back to your 70–30 target. The key is to rebal-ance on a predictable, patient schedule—not so often that you will104 Commentary on Chapter 4

neously.

THE INS AND OUTS OF INCOME INVESTING
In Graham’s day, bond investors faced two basic choices: Taxable or
tax-free? Short-term or long-term? Today there is a third: Bonds orbond funds?
Taxable or tax-free? Unless you’re in the lowest tax bracket,
6you
should buy only tax-free (municipal) bonds outside your retirementaccounts. Otherwise too much of your bond income will end up in thehands of the IRS. The only place to own taxable bonds is inside your401(k) or another sheltered account, where you will owe no currenttax on their income—and where municipal bonds have no place, since
their tax advantage goes to waste.
7
Short-term or long-term? Bonds and interest rates teeter on
opposite ends of a seesaw: If interest rates rise, bond prices fall—
although a short-term bond falls far less than a long-term bond. On theother hand, if interest rates fall, bond prices rise—and a long-termbond will outperform shorter ones.
8You can split the difference simply106 Commentary on Chapter 4
6For the 2003 tax year, the bottom Federal tax bracket is for single people
earning less than $28,400 or married people (filing jointly) earning less than
$47 ,450.
7Two good online calculators that will help you compare the after-tax in-
come of municipal and taxable bonds can be found at www.investinginbonds.com/cgi-bin/calculator.pl and www.lebenthal.com/index_infocenter.html. To
decide if a “muni” is right for you, find the “taxable equivalent yield” gener-ated by these calculators, then compare that number to the yield currently
available on Treasury bonds (http://money.cnn.com/markets/bondcenter/ or

be warned that municipal bonds and funds produce lower income, and
more price fluctuation, than most taxable bonds. Also, the alternative mini-mum tax, which now hits many middle-income Americans, can negate the
advantages of municipal bonds.

CHAPTER 8
The Investor and Market Fluctuations
To the extent that the investor’s funds are placed in high-grade
bonds of relatively short maturity—say, of seven years or less—he
will not be affected significantly by changes in market prices andneed not take them into account. (This applies also to his holdingsof U.S. savings bonds, which he can always turn in at his cost price
or more.) His longer-term bonds may have relatively wide price
swings during their lifetimes, and his common-stock portfolio isalmost certain to fluctuate in value over any period of several
years.
The investor should know about these possibilities and should
be prepared for them both financially and psychologically. He will
want to benefit from changes in market levels—certainly throughan advance in the value of his stock holdings as time goes on, andperhaps also by making purchases and sales at advantageous
prices. This interest on his part is inevitable, and legitimate
enough. But it involves the very real danger that it will lead himinto speculative attitudes and activities. It is easy for us to tell you
not to speculate; the hard thing will be for you to follow this
advice. Let us repeat what we said at the outset: If you want tospeculate do so with your eyes open, knowing that you will proba-
bly lose money in the end; be sure to limit the amount at risk and to
separate it completely from your investment program.
We shall deal first with the more important subject of price
changes in common stocks, and pass later to the area of bonds. In Chapter 3 we supplied a historical survey of the stock market’saction over the past hundred years. In this section we shall returnto that material from time to time, in order to see what the pastrecord promises the investor—in either the form of long-termappreciation of a portfolio held relatively unchanged through 
188

As we have seen in Chapter 3, stocks are (as of early 2003) only
mildly overpriced by historical standards. Meanwhile, at recent prices,
bonds offer such low yields that an investor who buys them for theirsupposed safety is like a smoker who thinks he can protect himselfagainst lung cancer by smoking low-tar cigarettes. No matter how
defensive an investor you are—in Graham’s sense of low maintenance,or in the contemporary sense of low risk—today’s values mean that you
must keep at least some of your money in stocks.
Fortunately, it’s never been easier for a defensive investor to buy
stocks. And a permanent autopilot portfolio, which effortlessly puts a
little bit of your money to work every month in predetermined invest-ments, can defend you against the need to dedicate a large part ofyour life to stock picking.
SHOULD YOU “BUY WHAT YOU KNOW”?
But first, let’s look at something the defensive investor must always
defend against: the belief that you can pick stocks without doing anyhomework. In the 1980s and early 1990s, one of the most popular
investing slogans was “buy what you know. ” Peter Lynch—who from
1977 through 1990 piloted Fidelity Magellan to the best track recordever compiled by a mutual fund—was the most charismatic preacher of
this gospel. Lynch argued that amateur investors have an advantage
that professional investors have forgotten how to use: “the power ofcommon knowledge. ” If you discover a great new restaurant, car,
toothpaste, or jeans—or if you notice that the parking lot at a nearby
business is always full or that people are still working at a company’sheadquarters long after Jay Leno goes off the air—then you have a per-
sonal insight into a stock that a professional analyst or portfolio man-
ager might never pick up on. As Lynch put it, “During a lifetime ofbuying cars or cameras, you develop a sense of what’s good and
what’s bad, what sells and what doesn’t . . . and the most important
part is, you know it before Wall Street knows it. ”

Question: As a beginner, should I invest in stocks or bonds? Why?
","As a beginner, the decision to invest in stocks or bonds largely depends on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Based on the context provided, here are some considerations:

1. **Risk Tolerance**: If you are risk-averse and prefer more stable and predictable returns, bonds may be a better choice. Bonds typically offer more certainty in terms of interest and principal payments compared to stocks, which can be more volatile and subject to market fluctuations.

2. **Investment Goals**: If you need your investments to supplement your cash income, bonds are generally more suitable, as they provide regular interest payments. Stocks, on the other hand, do not guarantee dividends and can fluctuate in value.

3. **Market Conditions**: The context suggests that, as of late 1971, bonds appeared preferable to stocks due to their more favorable yield relationship. However, it also acknowledges the potential for inflation and other factors that could make stocks more attractive in the future.

4. **Long-Term Perspective**: If you are willing to take on more risk for the potential of higher returns over the long term, you might consider allocating a portion of your investments to stocks. A balanced approach, such as Graham's recommendation of having at least 25% in bonds or cash, could be a prudent strategy for beginners.

5. **Rebalancing**: It's important to regularly reassess your investment allocation based on changes in your life circumstances and market conditions. A disciplined approach to rebalancing your portfolio can help you maintain your desired risk level.

In summary, if you are a beginner with a low risk tolerance and a need for stable income, starting with bonds may be advisable. If you are open to higher risks for potential growth, consider a mixed approach with some allocation to stocks. Always remember to adjust your investment strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.",8.421467304229736
How do I evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued?,"Human: Answer the following question based on this context:

All told, 273 companies (or 55% of the index) have price-to-book
ratios of less than 2.5.
What about Graham’s suggestion that you multiply the P/E ratio by
the price-to-book ratio and see whether the resulting number is below
22.5? Based on data from Morgan Stanley, at least 142 stocks in theS & P 500 could pass that test as of early 2003, including DanaCorp., Electronic Data Systems, Sun Microsystems, and Washington
Mutual. So Graham’s “blended multiplier” still works as an initial
screen to identify reasonably-priced stocks.
DUE DILIGENCE
No matter how defensive an investor you are—in Graham’s sense of
wishing to minimize the work you put into picking stocks—there are a
couple of steps you cannot afford to skip:
Do your homework. Through the EDGAR database at www.sec.
gov, you get instant access to a company’s annual and quarterly
reports, along with the proxy statement that discloses the managers’
compensation, ownership, and potential conflicts of interest. Read at
least five years’ worth.

Check out the neighborhood. Websites like http://quicktake.
morningstar.com, http://finance.yahoo.com and www.quicken.com can
readily tell you what percentage of a company’s shares are owned byinstitutions. Anything over 60% suggests that a stock is scarcely
undiscovered and probably “overowned. ” (When big institutions sell,
they tend to move in lockstep, with disastrous results for the stock.Imagine all the Radio City Rockettes toppling off the front edge of the
stage at once and you get the idea.) Those websites will also tell you
who the largest owners of the stock are. If they are money-management firms that invest in a style similar to your own, that’s a
good sign.Commentary on Chapter 14 375
4For more on what to look for, see the commentary on Chapters 11, 12, and
19. If you are not willing to go to the minimal effort of reading the proxy and
making basic comparisons of financial health across five years’ worth ofannual reports, then you are too defensive to be buying individual stocks atall. Get yourself out of the stock-picking business and into an index fund,where you belong.

Rarely does one find a brokerage-house study that points out, 
with a convincing array of facts, that a popular industry is head-
ing for a fall or that an unpopular one is due to prosper. Wall
Street’s view of the longer future is notoriously fallible, and thisnecessarily applies to that important part of its investigationswhich is directed toward the forecasting of the course of profits invarious industries.
We must recognize, however, that the rapid and pervasive
growth of technology in recent years is not without major effect onthe attitude and the labors of the security analyst. More so than inthe past, the progress or retrogression of the typical company in the
coming decade may depend on its relation to new products and
new processes, which the analyst may have a chance to study andevaluate in advance. Thus there is doubtless a promising area for
effective work by the analyst, based on field trips, interviews with
research men, and on intensive technological investigation on his
own. There are hazards connected with investment conclusions
derived chiefly from such glimpses into the future, and not sup-
ported by presently demonstrable value. Yet there are perhapsequal hazards in sticking closely to the limits of value set by sober
calculations resting on actual results. The investor cannot have it
both ways. He can be imaginative and play for the big profits thatare the reward for vision proved sound by the event; but then he
must run a substantial risk of major or minor miscalculation. Or he
can be conservative, and refuse to pay more than a minor premiumfor possibilities as yet unproved; but in that case he must be pre-
pared for the later contemplation of golden opportunities foregone.
A Two-Part Appraisal Process
Let us return for a moment to the idea of valuation or appraisal
of a common stock, which we began to discuss above on p. 288. Agreat deal of reflection on the subject has led us to conclude that
this better be done quite differently than is now the establishedpractice. We suggest that analysts work out first what we call the“past-performance value,” which is based solely on the pastrecord. This would indicate what the stock would be worth—absolutely, or as a percentage of the DJIA or of the S & P compos-ite—if it is assumed that its relative past performance will continueSecurity Analysis for the Lay Investor 299

Even at a robust 10% annual rate of return, it will take more than 43
years to break even on this overpriced purchase!
THE RISK IS NOT IN OUR STOCKS, 
BUT IN OURSELVES
Risk exists in another dimension: inside you. If you overestimate 
how well you really understand an investment, or overstate your abilityto ride out a temporary plunge in prices, it doesn’t matter what you
own or how the market does. Ultimately, financial risk resides not in
what kinds of investments you have, but in what kind of investor you
are. If you want to know what risk really is, go to the nearest bathroomand step up to the mirror. That’s risk, gazing back at you from the
glass.
As you look at yourself in the mirror, what should you watch for?
The Nobel-prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains twofactors that characterize good decisions:
•“well-calibrated confidence” (do I understand this investment as
well as I think I do?)
•“correctly-anticipated regret” (how will I react if my analysis
turns out to be wrong?).
To find out whether your confidence is well-calibrated, look in the
mirror and ask yourself: “What is the likelihood that my analysis is
right?” Think carefully through these questions:
• How much experience do I have? What is my track record with
similar decisions in the past?
• What is the typical track record of other people who have tried
this in the past?

• If I am buying, someone else is selling. How likely is it that I know
something that this other person (or company) does not know?
• If I am selling, someone else is buying. How likely is it that I know
something that this other person (or company) does not know?528 Commentary on Chapter 20

estly accepted the results, would ever have day traded or bought IPOs.

the leading edge of the transformative software revolution”?)
These questions can also help you determine whether the people
who run the company will act in the interests of the people who own
the company:
• Are they looking out for No. 1?
A firm that pays its CEO $100 million in a year had better have a
very good reason. (Perhaps he discovered—and patented—the Foun-
tain of Youth? Or found El Dorado and bought it for $1 an acre? Or
contacted life on another planet and negotiated a contract obligat-
ing the aliens to buy all their supplies from only one company onEarth?) Otherwise, this kind of obscenely obese payday suggests
that the firm is run by the managers, forthe managers.
If a company reprices (or “reissues” or “exchanges”) its stock
options for insiders, stay away. In this switcheroo, a company can-
cels existing (and typically worthless) stock options for employeesand executives, then replaces them with new ones at advanta-geous prices. If their value is never allowed to go to zero, while
their potential profit is always infinite, how can options encourage
good stewardship of corporate assets? Any established companythat reprices options—as dozens of high-tech firms have—is a dis-
grace. And any investor who buys stock in such a company is a
sheep begging to be sheared.
By looking in the annual report for the mandatory footnote
about stock options, you can see how large the “option overhang”is. AOL Time Warner, for example, reported in the front of itsannual report that it had 4.5 billion shares of common stock out-
standing as of December 31, 2002—but a footnote in the bowels
of the report reveals that the company had issued options on 657million more shares. So AOL’s future earnings will have to be
divided among 15% more shares. You should factor in the poten-
tial flood of new shares from stock options whenever you estimatea company’s future value.

Four—
A Better Way to Measure Performance
When the price of a stock can be influenced by a ""herd"" on Wall Street with prices set at the margin by the most emotional person, or the greediest person, or the most depressed person, it is hard to argue that the market always prices rationally. In fact, market prices are frequently nonsensical.
—Warren Buffett
If Buffett is right—if market prices are frequently nonsensical—then we are foolish indeed to use 
price as a sole indicator of performance. Yet we do. Our entire industry is price-myopic. If the price of a particular stock is going up, we assume good things are happening; if the price starts to go down, we assume something bad is happening, and we act accordingly. But if prices are not always completely rational, are we being completely rational when we base our actions on their ups and downs?
  

Question: How do I evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued?
","To evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued, you can follow these steps:

1. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Calculate the P/E ratio of the stock and compare it to the industry average or historical averages. A significantly higher P/E ratio may indicate overvaluation, while a lower ratio could suggest undervaluation.

2. **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: Look at the price-to-book ratio. A P/B ratio of less than 2.5 is often considered reasonable. If the ratio is significantly higher, it may indicate that the stock is overvalued.

3. **Graham's Blended Multiplier**: Use Benjamin Graham's suggestion to multiply the P/E ratio by the P/B ratio. If the resulting number is below 22.5, it may indicate that the stock is reasonably priced. If it is above this threshold, the stock might be overvalued.

4. **Past Performance Value**: Assess the company's past performance to determine its historical value. This involves analyzing financial statements and performance metrics over at least five years to gauge whether the stock's current price reflects its historical performance.

5. **Market Sentiment and Institutional Ownership**: Check the percentage of shares owned by institutions. If over 60% of shares are held by institutions, it may indicate that the stock is widely owned and potentially overvalued. 

6. **Management Practices**: Investigate the company's management practices, including executive compensation and stock option policies. Excessive pay or stock option repricing can signal misalignment of interests between management and shareholders, which may affect the stock's valuation.

7. **Technological and Industry Trends**: Consider the company's position in relation to technological advancements and industry trends. Companies that are well-positioned to benefit from new technologies may be undervalued, while those lagging behind may be overvalued.

8. **Self-Assessment**: Reflect on your own understanding and confidence regarding the investment. Evaluate your experience and track record, and consider how likely it is that you know something that others do not.

By combining these methods, you can form a more comprehensive view of whether a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued.",31.626574754714966,"Human: Answer the following question based on this context:

Question: How do I evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued?
","To evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued, you can follow these steps:

1. **Compare Market Value to Intrinsic Value**: Assess what the market says a company is worth versus your own valuation of the company. This can involve using various methodologies such as discounted cash flow analysis, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, and price-to-book ratios.

2. **Use Valuation Ratios**: Look at key financial ratios:
   - **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Compare the company's P/E ratio to industry averages or historical values. A significantly higher P/E may indicate overvaluation, while a lower P/E could suggest undervaluation.
   - **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: A P/B ratio below 1 can indicate that the stock is undervalued relative to its book value.

3. **Blended Multiplier**: Graham's suggestion involves multiplying the P/E ratio by the P/B ratio and checking if the result is below 22.5. If it is, the stock may be reasonably priced.

4. **Analyze Earnings Trends**: Consider the company's earnings history and future projections. Look for cyclical patterns where earnings may be temporarily low but expected to recover.

5. **Assess Market Sentiment**: Be aware of market conditions and sentiment. Stocks may be undervalued due to temporary setbacks or lack of interest, which can create buying opportunities.

6. **Conduct Due Diligence**: Review the company's financial statements, management quality, dividend history, and overall financial health. Use resources like the SEC's EDGAR database to access annual and quarterly reports.

7. **Consider External Factors**: Evaluate the broader economic environment and industry trends that may impact the company's performance.

By combining these approaches, you can form a more comprehensive view of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued.",21.618255138397217,"Human: Answer the following question based on this context:

engraved stock certificate, which can be sold in a matter of minutes
at a price which varies from moment to moment—when the mar-
ket is open, that is—and often is far removed from the balance-sheet value.*
The development of the stock market in recent decades has
made the typical investor more dependent on the course of pricequotations and less free than formerly to consider himself merely a
business owner. The reason is that the successful enterprises in
which he is likely to concentrate his holdings sell almost constantlyat prices well above their net asset value (or book value, or 
“balance-sheet value”). In paying these market premiums the
investor gives precious hostages to fortune, for he must depend onthe stock market itself to validate his commitments.†
This is a factor of prime importance in present-day investing,
and it has received less attention than it deserves. The whole struc-ture of stock-market quotations contains a built-in contradiction.

It can be calculated using the bal-ance sheets in a company’s annual and quarterly reports; from total share-holders’ equity, subtract all “soft” assets such as goodwill, trademarks, andother intangibles. Divide by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding toarrive at book value per share.

6. Moderate Price/Earnings Ratio
Current price should not be more than 15 times average earn-
ings of the past three years.
7. Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets
Current price should not be more than 11⁄2times the book value last
reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a
correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb wesuggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to
book value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15times earnings and 1
1⁄2times book value. It would admit an issue sell-
ing at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)
General Comments: These requirements are set up especially
for the needs and the temperament of defensive investors. Theywill eliminate the great majority of common stocks as candidatesfor the portfolio, and in two opposite ways. On the one hand theywill exclude companies that are (1) too small, (2) in relatively weakfinancial condition, (3) with a deficit stigma in their ten-yearrecord, and (4) not having a long history of continuous dividends.Of these tests the most severe under recent financial conditions arethose of financial strength. A considerable number of our large and
formerly strongly entrenched enterprises have weakened their cur-
rent ratio or overexpanded their debt, or both, in recent years.
Our last two criteria are exclusive in the opposite direction, by
demanding more earnings and more assets per dollar of price thanthe popular issues will supply. This is by no means the standardviewpoint of financial analysts; in fact most will insist that even
conservative investors should be prepared to pay generous prices
for stocks of the choice companies. We have expounded our con-trary view above; it rests largely on the absence of an adequate fac-
tor of safety when too large a portion of the price must depend on
ever-increasing earnings in the future. The reader will have todecide this important question for himself—after weighing thearguments on both sides.
We have nonetheless opted for the inclusion of a modest
requirement of growth over the past decade. Without it the typicalcompany would show retrogression, at least in terms of profit perStock Selection for the Defensive Investor 349

unchanged in the future. (This includes the assumption that its rel-
ative growth rate, as shown in the last seven years, will also con-
tinue unchanged over the next seven years.) This process could be
carried out mechanically by applying a formula that gives individ-ual weights to past figures for profitability, stability, and growth,and also for current financial condition. The second part of theanalysis should consider to what extent the value based solely onpast performance should be modified because of new conditions
expected in the future.
Such a procedure would divide the work between senior and
junior analysts as follows: (1) The senior analyst would set up theformula to apply to all companies generally for determining past-
performance value. (2) The junior analysts would work up suchfactors for the designated companies—pretty much in mechanicalfashion. (3) The senior analyst would then determine to whatextent a company’s performance—absolute or relative—is likely todiffer from its past record, and what change should be made in 
the value to reflect such anticipated changes. It would be best if the
senior analyst’s report showed both the original valuation and themodified one, with his reasons for the change.
Is a job of this kind worth doing? Our answer is in the affirma-
tive, but our reasons may appear somewhat cynical to the reader.We doubt whether the valuations so reached will prove sufficiently
dependable in the case of the typical industrial company, great or
small. We shall illustrate the difficulties of this job in our discus-sion of Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) in the next
chapter. Nonetheless it should be done for such common stocks.Why? First, many security analysts are bound to make current or
projected valuations, as part of their daily work. The method we
propose should be an improvement on those generally followed
today. Secondly, because it should give useful experience andinsight to the analysts who practice this method. Thirdly, because
work of this kind could produce an invaluable body of recorded
experience—as has long been the case in medicine—that may leadto better methods of procedure and a useful knowledge of its pos-sibilities and limitations. The public-utility stocks might wellprove an important area in which this approach will show realpragmatic value. Eventually the intelligent analyst will confinehimself to those groups in which the future appears reasonably300 The Intelligent Investor

deserves our attention, and some newer issues have presented themselves: the economic value added 
(EVA) approach and the role of technology. Can we use the Warren Buffett Way template to pick technology companies?
Market Tenet: How to Value a Business
Determining the intrinsic value of a company—the first and most critical step in the Buffett decision 
process—is both art and science. The science involves a fairly straightforward bit of mathematics.
To calculate the current value of a business, you start by estimating the cash flows that you expect 
will occur over the life of the business and then discount that total backward to today, using an appropriate discount rate. ""If we could see, in looking at any business, its future cash inflows and outflows between the business and its owner over the next 100 years, or until the business is extinct, and then could discount them back at the appropriate interest rate, that would give us a number for 
intrinsic value,"" says Buffett. (OID) 
1 This concept, postulated by John Burr Williams in The Theory 
of Investment Value, is as true today as it was when first written more than sixty years ago.
Some people find it easier to compare this process to the one used when valuing a bond. The 
mathematics are the same. Instead of cash flow, bonds have coupons; instead of an indefinite period, bonds have a finite life, at which point they return the invested capital back to the owners. ""It would be like looking at a bond with a whole bunch of coupons on it that matured in a hundred years,"" explains Buffett. ""Well, businesses have coupons that are going to develop into the future, too. The only problem is that they aren't printed on the instrument. Therefore, it's up to the investor to estimate 
what those coupons are going to be."" (OID)

proper calculation of intrinsic valuation, not the end. The list of additional
factors he examines is seemingly endless and includes such things as the
current and prospective regulatory climate; state of labor , supplier , and
customer relations; potential impact of changes in technology; competitive
strengths and vulnerabilities; pricing power; scalability; environmental
issues; and, notably , the presence of hidden exposures (Charlie knows that
there is no such thing as a riskless investment candidate; he's searching for
those with few risks that are easily understandable). He record all financial
statement figures to fit his own view of reality , including the actual free or
""owners"" cash being produced, inventory and other working capital assets,
fixed assets, and such frequently overstated intangible assets as goodwill.
He also completes an assessment of the true impact, current and future, of
the cost of stock options, pension plans, and retiree medical benefits. He
applies equal scrutiny to the liability side of the balance sheet. For example,
under the right circumstances, he might view an obligation such as
insurance float-premium income that may not be paid out in claims for
many years-more properly as an asset. He especially assesses a company's
management well beyond conventional number crunching-in particular , the
degree to which they are ""able, trustworthy , and owner -oriented."" For
example, how do they deploy cash? Do they allocate it intelligently on
behalf of the owners, or do they overcompensate themselves, or pursue ego-
oriented growth for growth's sake? Above all, he attempts to assess and
understand competitive advantage in every respect-products, markets,
trademarks, employees, distribution channels, societal trends, and so on-and
the durability of that advantage. Charlie refers to a company's competitive
advantage as its ""moat"": the virtual physical barrier it presents against
incursions. Superior companies have deep moats that are continuously

Question: How do I evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued?
","To evaluate if a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued, you can follow several key steps based on the principles outlined in the provided context:

1. **Determine Intrinsic Value**: Start by estimating the intrinsic value of the company. This involves projecting the future cash flows that the business is expected to generate and discounting them back to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. This process is akin to valuing a bond, where you consider the cash flows (coupons) over time.

2. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Assess the company's current price in relation to its earnings. A moderate P/E ratio is suggested, where the current price should not exceed 15 times the average earnings of the past three years. If the P/E ratio is significantly higher than this benchmark, the stock may be overvalued.

3. **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: Evaluate the ratio of the current price to the company's book value. The current price should not be more than 1.5 times the last reported book value. If the price is significantly higher, it may indicate overvaluation.

4. **Growth Considerations**: Consider the company's growth rate. A company that has shown consistent growth over the past decade may justify a higher valuation. However, be cautious of relying too heavily on future growth projections, as they can be uncertain.

5. **Financial Strength**: Analyze the company's financial condition, including its current ratio and debt levels. Companies that have weakened their financial position may be riskier investments, potentially leading to overvaluation.

6. **Market Sentiment**: Recognize that stock prices can be influenced by market sentiment and investor behavior. The better a company's record and prospects, the less its share price may relate to its book value, leading to greater price fluctuations. This means that even fundamentally strong companies can have overvalued stocks if market sentiment is overly optimistic.

7. **Management Quality**: Assess the quality of the company's management. Consider whether they are trustworthy and focused on shareholder value. Poor management decisions can lead to overvaluation if they do not allocate resources effectively.

8. **Competitive Advantage**: Evaluate the company's competitive position or ""moat."" A strong competitive advantage can justify a higher valuation, but if the moat is weak or eroding, the stock may be overvalued.

By combining these analyses, you can form a more comprehensive view of whether a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued. Always consider the broader market context and be aware of the inherent risks in stock investing.",12.62417197227478
